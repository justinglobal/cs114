# Demo: Written Numbers

Create a program that asks for a number in base-10 that's between 1 and 99 then prints out the name of it in English.

> 45
> fourty-five
>
> 11
> eleven

Hint: Use a separate variable for each digit then put them together.

Hint 2: Make it work for regular combinations (like "forty-five") greater than 19 first.
