# Demo: Space Dungeon

Space Dungeon is a text based 'dungeon crawler' game set in a space ship.

Your task is to write a program that prints a title for the user and asks for their character name, and asks them what character type they want to be, and how many magic and attack points they want that add to 100.

Then print out what they chose for them.

Example:

"Ok Karen, you have chosen Mage with 70 magic points and 30 attack points"

### Adapt the game as much as you would like, it can be about anything you want. This is just an example.
