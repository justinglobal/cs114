# Practice: Case number lookup

Let's make a case number lookup program!

Write a program that takes in as many names and case numbers as the user wants then prints out the case number if a name is given or the name if the case number is given.

Every time you run the program, you program will ask the user to input names and case numbers, then ask them if they want to print more.

> "Enter first name and press enter"
> "Enter the Case Number"
> "Enter another?" #Here the user will answer yes or no

Then, when they answer 'no' the program will ask for a name for case number or something to end the program.

> Enter case number or name or type 'end' to finish

Hint 1: Use a dictionary of case number/name key/value pairs.

Hint 2: You will need to use a while loop for the entry and retrieval portions

Hint 3: Check out the logic of the program for intaking cat names on page 85 of "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" for example code using lists.
