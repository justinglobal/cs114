# Practice: Distance Converter

Save your solution as `distance-converter.py`.

Ask the user for a distance, then the units of that distance, then the target units.
Then print out the conversion as below.

> Enter a distance:
> 100
> Enter units:
> mi
> Enter target units:
> km
> 100 mi is 160.93440000000115 km

Start with converting Miles to Kilometers first.

Then, support converting between `mi`, `km`, `ft`, and `m`.

## Advanced

*   Also support converting between `in` and `cm`.

*   Also support converting between `gal` and `L`.
    Error if someone tries to convert between volume and distance.

## Super Advanced

Also support converting between all [metric prefixes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_prefix) of meters.
