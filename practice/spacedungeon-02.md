# Space Dungeon Part 2

Save this project as 'spacedungeon02.py'

Space Dungeon is a "Dungeon crawler" type text-based game. In space dungeon every character has magic points and hit points that decrease based on events in the game.

Part 1 - Spell casting: Create a program that prints a user's magic points and deducts 10 magic points for a 'spell' they cast while the number of magic points is greater than zero. Give the user 50 mp to start.

Part 2 - Attack: In the same program also make the program print a user's hit points and reduce their hit points for each 'attack' by 10 points in a range of 5. Give the user 50 mp to start.

Make user-interface text to communicate that magic and hit points are being reduced part of the loops, example:

> "You cast a spell"
> "30 mp remaining"
> "You cast a spell"
> "20 mp remaining"

<!-- Hint: Use a While loop for Part 1 and a For loop for part 2 -->

Advanced: Make the program deduct a random number of mp and hp for each spell and attack.

Advanced 2: Combine this program with your previous Space Dungeon program.
