Welcome to class!

Week 10 is here!!

Classes investigation: Let's try to use Classes!

Make a "Player" Class that has an __init__ and a __repr__ constructor function.

Give the "Player" Class basic attributes like HP, MP, AP, and DP.

Then make a function that updates the players HP.

If you like it, try implementing it into your code.

<!-- Open class github, terminal, slack, and brackets.

Opening exercise:

Make a program that uses a dictionary to store characters and their attributes
for a game. Use the class github and textbook instructions to guide you.

Your program should introduce itself, ask the user for name, character type,
hit points, and magic points.

Then print out the attributes the user chose, give them the option to change
an attribute and then end.

Save your file as character.py and send to instructor via slack. -->

<!-- Magic 8 Ball refactor with lists: https://github.com/justinglobal/cs114/blob/master/practice/magic8ball-list.md

Use functions and a list for your Magic 8 Ball program. -->

<!-- Do Space Dungeon part 1 if you haven't already: [Space Dungeon Intro](/practice/spacedungeon-01.md)

Then do part 2 here: Practice: [Space Dungeon Part 2](/practice/spacedungeon-02.md) -->

<!-- Write a program that takes in input from a user and returns a response based on the length of string the user inputs. -->


<!-- Week 2

Open class github, terminal, slack, and brackets

Opening exercise:

Write a program that asks the user for their name and then tells them how many letters are in their name.

Hint: Use the len() function to find the length of a string. -->

<!-- Week 7 - cs114

Thankful for Python

Open class github, Terminal, Slack, online textbook, and Atom

class github: github.com/justinglobal/cs114

Opening exercise - Space Dungeon random enemies:

Make program uses a List of 4 or more enemies your character might encounter in the space dungeon game, write a function that chooses a random enemy from the list and prints the enemy name for the user.

Save your program as spacedungeon-random-enemy.py
